# ExternalStartingItems
Allows you to get items at the start of the run.<br>
To select items, you can use an external application that you can get at https://github.com/mrchous/ExternalStartingItemsGUI <br><br>
If you don't want to use that app, you can dowload a config file from this repository. <i>It's located at externalitems/profiles.xml</i><br>
You need to put that file to _%appdata%/Roaming/externalitems_, and then change the amounts of items as you wish. You can find all of the item IDs at https://github.com/risk-of-thunder/R2Wiki/wiki/Item-&-Equipment-IDs-and-Names<br><br>
Supports modded items!
